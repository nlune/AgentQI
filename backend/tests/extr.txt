Material Description
The Reference Material is available in amber glass bottles containing 15 g of coal each. The bottles
were sealed with aluminum foil to close them airtight.

Recommended Use
BAM-S030 is explicitly meant only to be used in analytical laboratories. The intended purpose of
reference material BAM-S030 is the verification of analytical procedures equivalent to DIN 51718 [1],
DIN 51719 [2], and DIN 51720 [3] for the determination of the volatile compounds and ash content as
well as moisture in coal. It is also intended to be used in thermogravimetric analysers (MTGA) for the
determination of the parameters mentioned above. It is strongly recommended to handle and
dispose of the reference material in accordance with the guidelines for analytical coal samples legally
in force at the site of end use and disposal.

Transport and Storage
The material should be stored in a dry and clean environment at a temperature of 4 °(4 ± 2) C.
Transport can be done under normal ambient conditions.

Instructions for Use
Before withdrawing a sub-sample, the bottle should be allowed to reach room temperature.
Thereafter, the bottle should be closed tightly and stored at (4 ± 2) °C. The stability of the reference
material is not affected by short periods of handling at ambient temperature during transport and
use. The minimum sample size for a determination is 0.5 g.
All analytical results have to be corrected for dry mass content of the material which should be
determined using a separate sub-sample.

Metrological Traceability
The certified parameters volatile compounds and ash content as well as the informative parameter
moisture are determined only by weighing differences before and after heating the material.
Therefore, the values are directly traceable to the SI (Système International d’Unités).

The laboratory mean values have been examined statistically to eliminate outlying values. Where a ” --- ” appears in the
table it indicates that an outlying value has been omitted. A data set consists of at least 3 but usually 4 single values of one
laboratory. All values were corrected for the moisture content determined in the resp. laboratory.
  M  : mean of laboratory means
     s M : standard deviation of laboratory means
       is : averaged repeatability standard deviation (square root of the mean of laboratory variances)
